This was a solo project so my contribution was 100%. I believe that I did apply and build upon the skills identified in my self-assessment last fall. I created a application that tracks parking citations. The application displays a table, and users can either edit records in the table, add a new record, or print an existing record. I learned a lot while working on this project. I learned React, and I learned a little bit more about web application deployment. I also learned more about the process of creating and updating records in a database. Overall I improved build on my front-end skills, and added some new back-end skills. 

I wish I could have completed more with the application before the class is over. I still plan to add the user table, user authentication, and reporting. My main obstacle was time management. Balancing a full time job, two other classes, and this project proved to be more difficult than I anticipated. I feel like I could have managed my time better, but I am still proud of what I did accomplishment considering my circumstances.
