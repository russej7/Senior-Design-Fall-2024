My project is a web application that can be used by local police departments to track parking citations. This application is lightwieght and allows users to add citations, edit existing citations, and search for existing citations. The citations records maintain data like citation number, the location where the citation took place, the officer that iussed the citation, license plate number of the vehicle and more. Users can also print out citations using the application. 

The project will eventually include a user table for users that can access the application, an login method to authenticate users, and a reporting system.
