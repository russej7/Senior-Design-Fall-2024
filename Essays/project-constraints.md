##Project Constraints Essay
##Jason Russell

As far as major constraints for my project, I feel the only three that apply specifically are professional, security, and social. Since the project could potentially be used by clients of my current company, the result directly correlates with my professional development. It could also impact how clients view me professionally. For this reason, I need to ensure the project meets their needs.

Additionally, security is a significant concern, since the project might be used by these clients. As a technical consultant, itâ€™s important to ensure that our clients follow security protocols to protect their businesses. Therefore, my project will need to meet specific security requirements to safeguard client information. 

Finally, this project could potentially be used by local governments. Ideally, the project improves workflow for whoever uses it. I also hope it provides some value to the city in which it is being used.
